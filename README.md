## Overview
This project is a single-page web application that generates a **multiplication table dynamically** based on **four integer inputs** provided by the user:

- Horizontal Start (multiplier)
- Horizontal End (multiplier)
- Vertical Start (multiplicand)
- Vertical End (multiplicand)

The multiplication table is built **completely with JavaScript**—no static table exists in the HTML. Handling validation, visual structure, and error feedback are key parts of this assignment.

## Features & Requirements Implemented
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|:------:|------|
| Read 4 numeric values from user input | ✅ | Inputs read from form in `index.html` and processed in `app.js` |
| Validate user input and handle errors gracefully | ✅ | Inline messages, no popup alerts |
| Must support values between **-50 to 50** | ✅ | Checked in JS (`BOUNDS.min` / `BOUNDS.max`) |
| Prevent UI freezing for large tables | ✅ | Uses a cell count safety limit (`SAFE_CELL_BUDGET`) |
| Dynamically generate the table using JS | ✅ | Uses DocumentFragment for efficient rendering |
| Table is **styled** for readability | ✅ | Alternating row colors + hover highlighting |
| **Scrollable table** with **sticky top row + left column** | ✅ | Achieved using `position: sticky` in CSS |
| Works as a **single page web app** | ✅ | No page reloads or redirects |
| Hosted online using **GitHub Pages** | ⚠️ | Must complete deployment step |

## How It Works
1. User enters four integer values.
2. JavaScript:
   - Validates the values.
   - Normalizes swapped ranges (e.g., `8 to 4` → `4 to 8`).
   - Ensures values fall inside the allowed range.
   - Ensures the total number of table cells will not freeze the browser.
3. A multiplication table is generated by nested loops and inserted into the `<table>` element.
4. The table is placed inside a scrollable container while:
   - The **top row** remains fixed as column labels.
   - The **first column** remains fixed as row labels.

This makes the table easy to read even when very large.
